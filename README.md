Around the U.S. project on React, featuring authorization and registration.

This repository contains my own front-end project on React with added authorization and registration features.
I worked with previously built front end code from Sprint 11.

All authorization, registration and token requests go through to the server running on [https://register.nomoreparties.co](https://register.nomoreparties.co/).

Once user login, it's token it saved and they will not require to login again the next time their visit the website from a machine they used previously.

An InfoToolTip popup informs user on successfull or wrong request during registration or authentication.
All other functionnalities such as add new card, like or dislike a card, delete owned cards, edit profile and avatar are working perfectly.
